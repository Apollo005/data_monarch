# data_monarch

I am currently working on a data cleaning/filtering/visualization tool that has a subscription based service. 
This tool is applicable to a variety of consumer base: students, researchers, educators, journalists, businesses, etc.
Working with data is time consuming and can be very arduous at times if trying to code with low-intermediate coding skills, so this tool will make that task easier for all that use the tool!
